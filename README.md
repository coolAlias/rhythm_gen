A simple browser-based application for generating random rhythm patterns, intended for guitar but probably usable by most any instrument.

## Installation

The application can run in any modern browser, no internet or local server required.

1. Copy the contents of the /public_html folder to somewhere on your computer.

2. Right-click the index.html file in the /public_html directory.

3. Select the "Open with" option in the right-click context menu and choose your favorite browser.

4. You should now see the application running in your browser, just like any other web page, no interent required!

5. Enjoy your rhythm practice!

## How to Use

Once you have the application running in your browser, use it just like you would any other web page.

### Options

**Number of Bars** is the number of measures over which the rhythm will be played, most usually either 1 or 2. Max value is currently 5.

**Number of Beats** is the number of beats per bar, commonly 4. Max value is 9.

**Notes per Beat** is the number of notes in each beat, commonly 2. Max value is 8 (i.e. 32nd notes).

**Notes to Skip** is the number of notes to skip, i.e. the ones that will NOT be played; this is what makes a rhythm!

### Examples

Each example indicates the number of beats first followed by the notes per beat, e.g. B4 N2 is 4 beats of 2 notes.

- B4 N1 = 4 beats of one note each, i.e. counting on the beat in 4/4 time.

- B4 N2 = 4 beats of two notes each, i.e. 1+2+3+4+, perhaps the most common count in music.

- B4 N3 = 4 beats of three notes each, i.e. eighth-note triplets in 4/4 time.

- B4 N4 = 4 beats of four notes each, i.e. sixteenth notes in 4/4 time.

- B6 N2 = 6 beats of two notes each, useful for practicing many songs in 6/8 time.
